        <p>GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.</p>
        <p>A GraphQL service is created by defining types and fields on those types, then providing functions for each field on each type. For example, a GraphQL service that tells us who the logged in user is (<code>me</code>) as well as that user's name might look something like this:</p>
        <code>type Query {
            me: User
          }
          
          type User {
            id: ID
            name: String
          }</code>
        <li>Learn more about GraphQL â€” the query language, type system, how the GraphQL service works, as well as best practices for using GraphQL in the articles written in this section; they help to solve common problems.</li>

        <header>Queries and Mutations</header>
        <h3>Fields</h3>
        <p>At its simplest, GraphQL is about asking for specific fields on objects. Let's start by looking at a very simple query and the result we get when we run it:</p>
        <code>{
            hero {
              name
            }
          }
        </code>
        <code>{
            "data": {
              "hero": {
                "name": "R2-D2"
              }
            }
          }
        </code>
        <p>You can see immediately that the query has exactly the same shape as the result. This is essential to GraphQL, because you always get back what you expect, and the server knows exactly what fields the client is asking for.</p>
        <li>The field name returns a String type, in this case the name of the main hero of Star Wars, "R2-D2".</li>
      </section>
      <section id="schemas_and_types" class="main-section">
        <header>Schemas and Types</header>
        <h3>Type System</h3>
        <p>On this page, you'll learn all you need to know about the GraphQL type system and how it describes what data can be queried. Since GraphQL can be used with any backend framework or programming language, we'll stay away from implementation-specific details and talk only about the concepts.</p>
        <p>If you've seen a GraphQL query before, you know that the GraphQL query language is basically about selecting fields on objects. So, for example, in the following query:</p>
        <code>{
            hero {
              name
              appearsIn
            }
          }
        </code>
        <code>{
            "data": {
              "hero": {
                "name": "R2-D2",
                "appearsIn": [
                  "NEWHOPE",
                  "EMPIRE",
                  "JEDI"
                ]
              }
            }
          }
        </code>
        <li>We start with a special "root" object</li>
        <li>We select the hero field on that</li>
        <li>For the object returned by hero, we select the name and appearsIn fields</li>
      </section>
      <section id="validation" class="main-section">
        <header>Validation</header>
        <p>For our Star Wars example, the file starWarsValidation-test.js contains a number of queries demonstrating various invalidities, and is a test file that can be run to exercise the reference implementation's validator.</p>
        <p>To start, let's take a complex valid query. This is a nested query, similar to an example from the previous section, but with the duplicated fields factored out into a fragment:</p>
        <code>{
            hero {
              ...NameAndAppearances
              friends {
                ...NameAndAppearances
                friends {
                  ...NameAndAppearances
                }
              }
            }
          }
          
          fragment NameAndAppearances on Character {
            name
            appearsIn
          }</code>
          <code>
            {
                "data": {
                  "hero": {

        <li>This has just scratched the surface of the validation system; there are a number of validation rules in place to ensure that a GraphQL query is semantically meaningful. The specification goes into more detail about this topic in the "Validation" section, and the validation directory in GraphQL.js contains code implementing a specification-compliant GraphQL validator.</li>

        <p>After being validated, a GraphQL query is executed by a GraphQL server which returns a result that mirrors the shape of the requested query, typically as JSON.</p>
        <p>GraphQL cannot execute a query without a type system, let's use an example type system to illustrate executing a query. This is a part of the same type system used throughout the examples in these articles:</p>
        <code>type Query {
            human(id: ID!): Human

          type Human {
